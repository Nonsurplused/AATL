 Spoilers/Walkthrough
======================

Njiira can be found in the Cavern of the Incarnate. She will give you a Khajiit Moon Amulet, where you must take to the location where ash meets between two lush valleys (Spoilers, the actual location is in Zainsipilu, an interior cell).

Bring the amulet to there, and locate the Buried Daedric Engraving, which will only appear after receiving this quest. Activate it, and receive your new awesome weapon, Azurah's Guidance!

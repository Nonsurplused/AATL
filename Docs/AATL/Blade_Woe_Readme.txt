 Spoilers/Walkthrough
======================

Asking around Suran after reaching level 15 will reveal discussion about a rather rude Altmer named Niya. Players will quickly learn that she wasn't well loved. If players take the road out of Suran (Spoilers, cell (3, -8)) they will encounter a dark brotherhood assassin who will have recently eliminated a target. That assassin will be wielding the legendary Blade of Woe, and will be a rather tough fight.

 What is AATL?
===============

AATL, or An Addendum to Tamrielic Lore (Sometimes shortened to ATL, not to be confused with Project Atlas) is an attempt to bring many of the missing artifacts from the other Elder Scrolls games to Morrowind.

But that doesn't mean just flooding Morrowind with Artifacts just because we can. That would be silly, and quickly get old. How many weapons does it take before you only use the strongest available? With that in mind, each new artifact brought forth in ATL intends to limit item spam by adding special effects to many of the new items that stems beyond their ability to sit there and look pretty (some still do of course... it wouldn't be fun if *every* item you got had those special effects).

ATL hopes to bring more love to the artifacts of the Elder Scrolls. Most must be earned before they can be wielded, either through test of courage, cunning, or wisdom. But what is ATL Data and why should you care? 

ATL Data hopes to achieve two things: provide a baseline for ATL, and allow other modders to make mods with ATL assets without relying on ATL for whatever reason.

So should you use ATL? Not necessarily. There aren't many mods that use ATL Data right now (minus the ones on this data page). ATL Data will be updated as frequently as needed and then (hopefully) some with new content and mods that require it.

Starting 0.2, releases will be focused on a specific artifact (barring hotfixes), either revamping, adding, or adding resources specifically for that mod. OAAB_Data.esm will be a requirement for most future mods, as AATL will be integrating many of its more generic resources with OAAB_Data.esm shortly.

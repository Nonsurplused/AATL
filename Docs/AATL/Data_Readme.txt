 What is AATL?
===============

AATL, or An Addendum to Tamrielic Lore (Sometimes shortened to AATL) is an attempt to bring many of the missing artifacts from the other Elder Scrolls games to Morrowind, and add new, lore-friendly artifacts as well to further flesh out some of the Morrowind experience.

But that doesn't mean just flooding Morrowind with Artifacts just because we can. That would be silly, and quickly get old. How many weapons does it take before you only use the strongest available? With that in mind, each new artifact brought forth in AATL intends to limit item spam by adding special effects to many of the new items that stems beyond their ability to sit there and look pretty (some still do of course... it wouldn't be fun if *every* item you got had those special effects).

AATL hopes to bring more love to the artifacts of the Elder Scrolls. Most must be earned before they can be wielded, either through test of courage, cunning, or wisdom.

AATL_Data hopes to achieve two things: provide a baseline for AATL, and allow other modders to make mods with AATL assets without relying on ATL for whatever reason.

AATL Main hopes to implement everything in AATL_Data, while providing exciting new content to Morrowind.
